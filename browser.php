<p class="intro">If you've arrived at this page, you must have seen a message asking you to upgrade your browser.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web changes quickly, and we do our best to support all web standards and recent web browsers. Unfortunately, some ancient web browsers &mdash; we're not pointing any fingers, but this means Internet Explorer 6 and 7 &mdash; just can't keep up with the new standards. The site may still work for you, but certain features may not, and it may not look as good as our developer, Paul, designed it to look.</p>
<p>That's why we recommend that everyone upgrade to the newest version of their web browser. Our personal favourites are Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, but Internet Explorer is decent too &mdash; as long as you are using version 8 or newer.</p>
<h3>how to upgrade</h3>
<ul class="box">
	<li>
		<h4>Internet Explorer</h4>
		<ul class="normal">
			<li><em>Windows XP users</em> can upgrade from version 6 or 7 to version 8 by running Windows Update or by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx">installing from Microsoft's website</a>. (Note: You may need to install Windows XP Service Pack 2 or 3 first.)</li>
			<li><em>Windows Vista users</em> can upgrade from version 7 to version 9 by running Windows Update or by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx">installing from Microsoft's website</a>.</li>
			<li><em>Windows 7 users</em> are lucky enough to already have IE8 installed! For the best experience, however, we recommend <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx">upgrading to version 9</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Mozilla Firefox</h4>
		<p>If you have Firefox 3, it should already automatically have upgraded to version 4 or newer. If it hasn't (you can check by going 'Help' &gt; 'About Firefox'), you can download the newest version from <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">getfirefox.com</a>. Make sure you close Firefox before you install the newest version!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Safari</h4>
		<p>You can upgrade to your operating system's newest supported version of Safari by running Apple Software Update.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Google Chrome</h4>
		<p>You can download the newest version of Chrome from <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google's website</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Opera</h4>
		<p>You can download the newest version of Opera from <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera's website</a>.</p>
