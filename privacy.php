<h3>Data Collection and its Purpose</h3>

<p>We collect the personal data that you or your authorised agent may volunteer while using our services.</p>

<p>We may supplement the personal information we have collected about our visitors from other sources, such as telephone directories or private organisations. This information will only be collected when our visitors' supplied information is incorrect or incomplete. We do not collect financial identifiers such as credit card numbers, but we may keep accounting records of each customer who conducts financial transactions with our company.</p>

<p>We only collect personal data for the purposes of technical administration, customer administration, internal marketing purposes, and company-to-customer communications. If we wish to use your personal data for new purposes, we offer you the means to consent to those new purposes:</p>

<ul class="normal">

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. However, if it is brought to our attention that we have unknowingly collected personal data from children, we take specific steps to protect the privacy of children by making reasonable efforts to ensure that a parent or legal guardian has authorised the collection of the child's personal data. If we have determined that a parent or legal guardian has not authorised the collection of the child's personal data, we will destroy such personal data.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Disclosure and Visitor Choice</h3>

<p>We may disclose our visitors' personal data to our subsidiaries or other organisations. However, we will always ask our visitors for permission to disclose their personal data to third parties by allowing them to opt in at the site where personal data is collected.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality / Security</h3>

<p>We do not give visitors to our Web site the option of using a secure transmission method to send us their personal data.

<p>We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from:</p>

<ul class="normal">
	<li>unauthorised access</li>
	<li>improper use or disclosure</li>
	<li>unauthorised modification</li>
	<li>unlawful destruction or accidental loss</li>
</ul>

<p>All our employees and data processors, who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal data, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our visitors' personal data.</p>

<p>We ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to State institutions and authorities except if required by law or other regulation.</p>
