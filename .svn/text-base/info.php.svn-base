<p>selection of produce, fruit, bulk goods, bakery, meats, dairy, beverages and cleaning supplies, all displayed on our online market. Ordering is as simple as the click of your mouse on desired items, which are added to your online shopping list. <strong>The minimum order is $25 for custom and surprise orders </strong>with free delivery to your home or office. We deliver to Summerland, Naramata, Penticton , OK Falls, Oliver, Osoyoos and all points in between. </p>
<br>        
<span class="subtitlefont">Online Ordering:</span><br>
<br>
<span class="subtitlefont2">Ordering:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders can be placed until 12 pm lunchtime before your scheduled delivery for your area. For example, if you live in Summerland, you may place an order up until 12 noon on Tuesday or 12 noon on Friday, depending on your day for delivery. However, if you can order 3 days in advance, it helps us order accurate amounts of product. Also, orders are packed according to when they are received, so the sooner you can order, the more likely we can provide all of the items that you order. In Penticton , we now offer delivery (by bicycle) from Tuesday through Saturday, every day of the week! A new list of items is posted every Friday afternoon, and a reminder email is sent out to help you remember to place your order. 
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once signed in, you are taken to the Online Market. The Market is divided into several different sections, each with a list of products. Click on the picture of the section that you would like to see. Browse the list of products by scrolling down the list, and choose products by checking off the box &amp; quantity desired beside the item you want to order. Items selected are transferred over to your shopping list, and a total for your order is tallied up as you choose more items. Once you have successfully submitted your order, a receipt of the transaction is sent to your email address. Occasionally an order does not go through properly, and a good indication of this is when you do not receive a receipt to your email account. In this case, please contact us for further assistance. </p>
<br>
<span class="subtitlefont2">Products:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we would like to eventually only supply products from the Okanagan and BC, products are labeled according to where they come from; town names or abbreviations of provinces/states are used to do this. Also, we go to extreme lengths to have your items harvested or baked only 1 - 2 days before it arrives at your doorstep! That is the definition of fresh! 
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>All items are certified organic, unless otherwise indicated. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have ideas for products you would like to see us carry, please send us a note at the bottom of your order in the comments section. </p><br>

<span class="subtitlefont2">Recipes:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we would like to give everyone a copy of our favorite recipe books, we know that you, the discerning customer, often have the most amazing formulas that have passed the taste test time and time again. As such we have added a RECIPE section at the top of the Market area. This area allows you to post your own recipes, and view those of other clients. We truly appreciate the need for more innovative ways to use and celebrate those seasonal veggies! <br>
<br>
<span class="subtitlefont2">Canceling or Missing an Order:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to cancel your order for the week, you must notify us 3 days in advance of your scheduled delivery. You may cancel two deliveries in a row, but we reserve the right to replace you with a member on our waiting list if you do not continue with your schedule of deliveries. <br>
<br>
<span class="subtitlefont2">Credit:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Credit is given towards your next purchase for any items that are not to your satisfaction </strong><strong>, or that are out of stock </strong>. Notify us if you are unsatisfied and we will add credit to your next purchase using our <strong>Online Accounting </strong> system. We add any credit to your account 3 days following your delivery, and this amount will be automatically deducted from the total of your next order using our <strong>Online Accounting </strong> system. <br><br />        
<span class="subtitlefont"> <em>Surprise Orders</em>:</span><br>        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers that do not use internet or do not wish to go online to customize orders, and would still like to receive regular bins may request a recurring surprise order. Surprise orders will be at a set price, from $25 to $50, and bins contain a great variety of seasonal fruits and veggies. These are either scheduled for every week or two weeks. This is a great way to make sure you eat your veggies, and it helps customers that may have trouble remembering to place their orders on time. Generally surprise orders tend to be a bit of a better deal compared to customized orders. Choose a day for the delivery in your area, some areas offer 2 days per week, 5 days a week in Penticton . Surprise orders may be requested by phoning Localmotive at (250) 486-3743. <br>

<span class="subtitlefont">Your Delivery:</span><br>

<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold packs will keep your delivery cool, but please indicate a shady location if you are not home during the day. Also, if you order dairy, meat products, or frozen meals, please set out a cooler that we can transfer your items into so as to avoid spoilage. For an extra $22, we supply a mist wand, which hooks up to a garden hose, and sprays a cooling mist over your bin, significantly reducing the heat in and around the bin. </p>
<br />
<span class="subtitlefont">Payment:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total price for your order is indicated once you have clicked on the SUBMIT Order button. Payment is made upon delivery of your bin. Localmotive accepts cash, cheques made out to Localmotive, or credit card. Pre-payment for multiple bins is easy with our online accounting system. 
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To pay by credit card, you may choose to do so once completed ordering. You are taken to a secure PayPal site, where you can setup an account, and payment is made directly through this account to Localmotive. You are taken to PayPal to complete payments each time you order online. A 3% fee is added for credit card payments. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <strong>$12 deposit </strong> is required for your bin and cold packs, and this will be only added to the price of your first delivery. The day of your next delivery, set out your bin from the previous delivery, and we'll take it home to be cleaned and reused. We keep track of bins that are not placed out, and will charge an extra $12 to your account after 2 bins are not returned. </p><br>

<span class="subtitlefont">Composting:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we will be picking-up your box from the previous week, you 
<p>may leave compost scraps in the bin for us to take away, helping to </p>
<p>reduce the volume of garbage waste. We will accept compost that is </p>
<p>no older than 6 days old, is not cooked, and contains no meat </p>
<p>products. We provide a compost bucket with a lid for each new customer, and you can set out this bucket with your old bin on your delivery day. We will empty the bucket and leave it there for you. </p><br><br>
<span class="subtitlefont">The Veggie Rap:</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a month our newsletter, The Veggie Rap, comes with your bin. The Veggie Rap contains recipes, ideas, profiles on farmers, community events and is open for submissions!</td>
