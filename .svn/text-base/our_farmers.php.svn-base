<h2>Our Farmers</h2>
<p><img src="img/farmer.jpg" class="alignleft" style="position: relative; left: -10px;" alt="farmer"/>In order to promote a more sustainable food system, we source as many of our products from local organic farmers and businesses as possible. By expanding the market for local organic products, we hope to help our regional growers make the transition into production that protects the environment. As local production increases, reliance upon imported foods will decrease, as will air pollution associated with lengthy transportation.</p>

<p>Some of our local farmers are members of the Conservation Partners Program (CPP), an initiative of The Land Conservancy of BC, where participants choose to protect and conserve significant portions of their land for habitat purposes.
