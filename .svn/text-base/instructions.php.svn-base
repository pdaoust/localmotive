      <span class="subtitlefont">The Market Station and Your Shopping List:<br>
      </span> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To order from our Produce Station, click the box beside the
      desired items in the list on the right, and then click on the &quot;add to
      list&quot;. These items are added to your shopping list. If a box is
      inactive and the writing faded, it means that the item is temporarily
      out of stock.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue shopping at the Market by clicking on the graphic of
      the different market sections, either Dairy, Meats, Bulk, Baked or
      Extras. Check items as desired until your order is <strong>$25 or more</strong>.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your shopping is complete go to the bottom of the page
      and click the Submit button to finalize the transaction. (Please try to
      avoid clicking this button numerous times as it affects our ordering
      system). A summary of your order is then stated with the total price,
      and confirmation email will be sent to you to as a final indicator that
      the order was received. A similar receipt will be placed in your bin
      when you receive your order. If you have ordered an item that we
      cannot supply, we will circle this item on your receipt, and calculate
      the credit for the missing items.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Credit is given towards your next purchase for any items
      that are not to your satisfaction</strong>, so notify us if you are unsatisfied
      and we will add credit to your next purchase using our <strong>Online
      Accounting system</strong>. We add any credit to your account on Fridays,
      and this amount will be automatically deducted from the total of your
      next order.<br>
