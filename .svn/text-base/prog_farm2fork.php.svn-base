<h3>Yearly membership fees</h3>

<p>A <?= money_format(NF_MONEY, $svc->getDeposit()) ?> yearly membership fee is charged to each customer to help cover administration costs and other overhead.  Your membership fee will be billed automatically each year, according to the date your membership was activated.</p>

<h3>Delivery schedule</h3>

<ul class="normal">
	<li><strong>Wednesdays</strong>: Penticton, Summerland, Naramata, and Kelowna</li>
	<li><strong>Thursdays</strong>: Oliver and Osoyoos</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordering and ordering deadlines</h3>

<p>To order, <a href="market/">login to your account</a> using your e-mail address and your password. Follow the links to "Order items from the market", and you will be taken to the virtual farmers' market. Delivery minimum is <?= money_format(NF_MONEY, $svc->getMinOrder()) ?>. Choose from a variety of produce items, and add them to your shopping list. Proceed to the checkout when you are finished shopping. Ordering and delivery timelines are as follows:</p>

<ul class="normal">
	<li><strong>Wednesday delivery</strong>: Order from Friday noon until Sunday midnight</li>
	<li><strong>Thursday Delivery</strong>: Order from Friday noon until Sunday midnight</li>
</ul>

 <p>A "Market Update" email is sent out each Monday and Thursday at noon when the market is ready to take your orders. Orders placed outside of the ordering window may be bumped to the following delivery day. We prefer to process orders online to reduce administration costs, but are able to confirm by phone, fax, or e-mail if desired.</p>

<h3>Standing orders</h3>

<p>You can set up your order as a standing or 'recurring' order. This order will then be processed on a regular basis &mdash; every one, two, three, or four weeks. To set your order up as a recurring order, click the button labeled 'make recurring' at the bottom of the market, just below the shopping list. Your order will now allow you to choose how often you want to receive it.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen all of your items, proceed to the checkout and verify your shopping list. At this point, you have the opportunity to select items that you would like to order on a recurring basis. To do so, click on the <img src="market/img/inf.png" alt="infinity" title="infinity" class="icon"/> symbol beside the item so it is highlighted in green, and these items will be ordered on your behalf. For example, if you would like an assorted organic vegetable and fruit box delivered every week, simply add the Organic Veggie Box item to your order, and upon checkout, click on the <img src="market/img/inf.png" alt="infinity" title="infinity" class="icon"/> symbol, and you will have it delivered each week or two as desired.</p>

<p>You'll find that some items cannot be permanently added to your order. This is usually because they are seasonal or in short supply.</p>

<h3>Long weekends!</h3>
<p>On long weekends with a Monday holiday, our delivery service is bumped by one day, so that deliveries are on Wednesday and Saturday of the following week.</p>

<h3>Payment</h3>

<p>We accept payment by cheques made out to LocalMotive.</p>

<h3>Address</h3>

<p>2351 Allendale Rd.<br/>
Okanagan Falls, BC V0H 1R2</p>
